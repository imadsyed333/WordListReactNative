You can search your word list for words you want to see right away. You can edit words, or simply delete them if you wish. You can even get dictionary definitions of words with the tap of a button.

You can share words with friends through any social media or messaging platform of your choice. You can even import words that you have been sent, and add to your ever growing list of words.
